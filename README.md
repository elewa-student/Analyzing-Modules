# Reading Modules

For this project I read and analyzed several NPM modules.  Selecting packages and dependencies for projects is tricky and very important.  There are lots of forums and opinions, but at the end of the day there's the module's sourcecode and my project's sourcecode.  No one knows my project better than me so I need to be the final decider on whether a package is right for my project.  So here I am practicing navigating and assessing NPM packages
